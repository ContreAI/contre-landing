## Opening Patterns

Choose based on content type:

**For regulatory updates:**
> "California just updated its Transfer Disclosure Statement requirements. Here's what changes for agents starting [date] and what you need to do now."

**For document intelligence:**
> "HOA documents can run 200+ pages. Most agents skim them. That's how deals die three days before closing."

**For transaction management:**
> "15% of real estate deals fail before closing. Most of those failures are preventable."

**For brokerage operations:**
> "A 30-agent brokerage loses approximately $225,000 annually to failed transactions. Most brokers don't even track it."

**For consumer education:**
> "Your offer just got accepted. Now what? The next 30-45 days can feel like limbo, but here's exactly what's happening."

---

## Section Headers

Use clear, declarative H2s:

✅ "What Changed in the 2025 TDS"  
✅ "The Three Sections That Kill Deals"  
✅ "What This Costs Your Brokerage"  
✅ "What to Expect During Week One"  

❌ "Introduction" (meaningless)  
❌ "What You Need to Know" (vague)  
❌ "Conclusion" (just end strong)  

---

## Callout Boxes

Use sparingly for emphasis:

**For key stats:**
> 15% of real estate transactions fail before closing. For a 30-agent brokerage averaging $12,000 commission per deal, that's $225,000 in annual lost revenue.

**For warnings:**
> ⚠️ If HOA documents show pending litigation or special assessments, this needs to be disclosed to the buyer immediately—not discovered at closing.

**For Contre positioning:**
> Contre's document analysis flags these issues automatically, giving agents time to address them before they become deal-breakers.

## CTA Options

Match to avatar:

**Broker Ben:**
- "Calculate your brokerage's annual revenue loss"
- "Get a transaction risk assessment"
- "See how [peer brokerage type] reduced failures"

**Agent Amanda:**
- "Download the [relevant] checklist"
- "Get the deadline tracking template"
- "Try the document analyzer free"

**Hannah Homebuyer:**
- "Share this with your agent"
- "Download the buyer's timeline guide"
- "Ask your agent about transaction tracking"

---

## Tone Adjustments by Avatar

**Broker Ben:** Professional, ROI-focused, peer-to-peer. Lead with business impact.

**Agent Amanda:** Practical, action-oriented, encouraging. Lead with time savings or deal protection.

**Hannah Homebuyer:** Reassuring, jargon-free, educational. Define every term. Position agent as guide.
