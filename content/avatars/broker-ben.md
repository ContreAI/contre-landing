# Avatar: Broker Ben

**Full Name:** Benjamin "Ben" Morrison  
**Role:** Broker/Owner or Office Manager  
**Brokerage Size:** 20-100 agents  
**Experience:** 15+ years in real estate, 5+ in management  

---

## Demographics

- **Age:** 45-60
- **Location:** Suburban/metro markets
- **Tech Comfort:** Moderate (uses tools but isn't an early adopter)
- **Decision Authority:** Final say on technology purchases

---

## Primary Motivations

1. **Protect Revenue** - Every failed deal is lost commission. At 15% failure rate, a 30-agent brokerage loses ~$225K annually.
2. **Reduce Liability** - Missed deadlines and compliance errors create legal exposure
3. **Retain Top Agents** - Good agents leave brokerages with poor systems
4. **Competitive Edge** - Needs to differentiate from discount brokerages

---

## Pain Points

- Deals falling apart due to preventable errors
- No visibility into transaction pipeline health
- New agents making rookie mistakes repeatedly
- Time spent on administrative oversight instead of business development
- Liability concerns keeping them up at night
- Competition from tech-forward brokerages

---

## Objections to Overcome

| Objection | Response Angle |
|-----------|----------------|
| "We already have a transaction coordinator" | TCs can't catch everything; AI provides backup layer |
| "My agents won't use another tool" | This runs in background; minimal agent behavior change |
| "We've always done fine" | Calculate what "fine" is actually costing in failed deals |
| "Too expensive" | ROI math: prevents 2 failed deals = pays for itself 10x |
| "We tried tech before" | This isn't generic software; it's trained on YOUR forms |
