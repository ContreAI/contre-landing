## Path to Contre

Hannah doesn't buy Contre directly. The content strategy is:

1. **SEO Authority** - Rank for consumer real estate questions
2. **Agent Tool** - Agents share Contre content with clients
3. **Brand Awareness** - When agent mentions "our transaction intelligence system," buyer already trusts the source
4. **Brokerage Leverage** - Consumer-facing content becomes agent recruitment/retention tool
